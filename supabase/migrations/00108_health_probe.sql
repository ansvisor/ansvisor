-- Daily health report: time the dashboard's heaviest reads.
--
-- The Citations page once stopped opening on the largest brand: one read had
-- drifted past the 8 s statement timeout, and only a user noticed. The daily
-- health report (server/src/lib/health) times those reads every morning and
-- flags any that are getting close.
--
-- Most of them check membership through auth.uid(), so a service-role call
-- would return nothing in no time. health_probe runs one read the way the
-- page does — as the `authenticated` role, with a given organization
-- member's claims, both for this transaction only — and returns how long it
-- took. The role matters as much as the claims: run with row security
-- bypassed, the Competitors read planned differently and ran past 120 s,
-- against 6.9 s as the page runs it. Only the server's service role may call
-- it, and only for the reads named below.
