/**
 * "New signal detected": re-opening finished opportunities (#857, Phase 4).
 *
 * The signals under an opportunity keep moving after its work is done. When
 * a completed, measured opportunity has a reason to be worked on again, it
 * goes back to New — the same row, with what changed recorded on it — rather
 * than a near-copy being generated beside it. Two reasons count:
 *
 * - its cluster's score rose by SCORE_RISE points since it was scored: more
 *   demand, or competitors further ahead (the spec's "strengthens");
 * - the gain its work measured was lost: the basket's visibility fell below
 *   GAIN_LOST_RATIO of the "after" value its action measured.
 *
 * An opportunity is only considered once all its actions are completed and
 * measured, so nothing re-opens in the weeks before its result is known.
